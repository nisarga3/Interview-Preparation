- Skills:
    - Python
        - dynamically typed
            - The association of a variable type is done during execution
        - interpreted
            - Runs with an interpreter. The translate decode and execute happen parallely

    When to use SQL instead of NoSQL

    01

    You’re working with complex queries and reports.

    With SQL you can build one script that retrieves and presents your data. NoSQL doesn’t support relations between data types.
     Running queries in NoSQL is doable, but much slower.

    02

    You have a high transaction application.

    SQL databases are a better fit for heavy duty or complex transactions because it’s more stable and ensure data integrity.

    03

    You need to ensure ACID compliance.

    (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) or defining exactly how transactions interact with a database. 

    04

    You don’t anticipate a lot of changes or growth.

    If you’re not working with a large volume of data or many data types, NoSQL would be overkill.
